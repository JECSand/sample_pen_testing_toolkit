# sample_pen_testing_toolkit
A collection of useful pen testing scripts I wrote in Python. The kit includes a port scanner, an email dictionary attack, and a ssh dictionary attack. This code is strictly for educational/legitimate use only. To help discourage malicious misuse of my code some advanced functionality was left out deliberately. I am 100% against any illegal activities.
